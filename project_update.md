## ‚úÖ Project Status

We currently have a **working MVP prototype** of our housing chatbot. It uses Bloom's seeded data to return 5 real listings with links, allowing frontline users to interact with a simplified version of the eventual application.

All major parts of the stack are in place:
- Frontend UI
- Backend API integration
- LLM service (Python-based) with seeded data support

## ü§ù Team Collaboration

Everyone on the team has contributed to this repo:
- Backend development
- Frontend integration
- Styling & UI
- API scaffolding
- LLM service setup
- Documentation and project planning

We've been coordinating using both our **GitHub Project board** and a shared **Notion workspace** to assign tasks, track bugs, and map out development flow.
