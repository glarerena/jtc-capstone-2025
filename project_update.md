## ‚úÖ Project Status

We currently have a **fully functioning chatbot** in the final phase of development. Originally called the **Bloom Assistant**, the project has now been rebranded as the **HERO Chatbot (Housing Essential Resource Organization)**. It helps frontline workers access housing listings and application information using Bloom's seeded data.

Key functionality includes:
- AMI (Area Median Income) filtering for personalized listings
- User-friendly UI with improved styling and focus behavior
- Backend API integration and Python-based LLM service

## ü§ù Team Collaboration

Every member of our team has contributed across all three project phases:

- **Phase 1**: MVP prototype under the name *Bloom Assistant*
- **Phase 2**: Feature enhancements and expanded logic
- **Phase 3**: Final styling, renaming to HERO, and polishing for graduation

We've used:
- **Notion** to assign and track tasks across all 3 phases
- **GitHub Projects** for sprint management and issue tracking
