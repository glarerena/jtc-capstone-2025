# Ethics Disclaimer

This chatbot was developed as part of a Capstone project for the Justice Through Code program at Columbia University. It is intended to assist users in finding affordable housing resources through a single-turn AI interaction.

## Purpose

The chatbot is designed to demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) can be used to support users in navigating housing-related information, such as application processes or eligibility questions. It serves as a proof-of-concept and is not a production system.

## AI Use and Limitations

- This is a single-turn chatbot powered by an LLM.
- It does **not** store any user data or conversation history.
- The model may generate incomplete, inaccurate, or outdated information.
- It is **not a substitute** for official housing assistance or legal advice.
- No personalization or user tracking is performed.

## Responsible AI Principles

This project follows the AI + Data Ethics Guidelines provided by Bloom Housing, which emphasize:

- **Transparency** – Clearly communicating how AI is used
- **Privacy** – No user data is stored or retained
- **Accountability** – The development team is responsible for how the model is integrated and presented
- **Fairness** – Efforts have been made to avoid biased or discriminatory outputs

## Final Notes

The chatbot is experimental. Users should verify any information provided with official sources or housing professionals.
