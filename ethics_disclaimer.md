# Ethics Disclaimer

This chatbot was developed as part of a Capstone project for the Justice Through Code program at Columbia University. It is intended to assist users in finding affordable housing resources through a single-turn AI interaction.

## Purpose

The chatbot is designed to demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) can be used to support users in navigating housing-related information, such as application processes or eligibility questions. It serves as a proof-of-concept and is not a production system.

## AI Use and Limitations

- This is a single-turn chatbot powered by an LLM.
- It does **not** store any user data or conversation history.
- The model may generate incomplete, inaccurate, or outdated information.
- It is **not a substitute** for official housing assistance or legal advice.
- No personalization or user tracking is performed.

## Example Message of Ethical Statement:

```
"This is a single-turn chatbot designed to assist with retrieving housing-related information. It does not retain memory between interactions and should not be used to make critical decisions without verification from official sources."
```

## Responsible AI Principles
