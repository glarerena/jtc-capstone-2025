âœ… Capstone MVP: Build Checklist (Days 1 & 2)
This checklist documents the major milestones completed during the 2-day solo prototype sprint for the Capstone MVP project â€” a single-turn RAG chatbot with no memory.

ðŸŸ© Day 1 â€“ Backend + Microservice Setup
âœ… Project Structure & Planning
 Created GitHub repo: chatbot

 Set up folders: api/, python-llm-service/, context/, sites/chatbot/, shared-helpers/

 Added .gitignore, .env, README.md, ethics_disclaimer.md, agile_plan.md

 Added placeholder files for planning and structure

âœ… NestJS Backend
 Scaffolded NestJS inside api/

 Deleted default controller and service

 Created chatbot.controller.ts with a POST /chatbot route

 Created chatbot.service.ts to forward requests to FastAPI

 Installed and configured axios for HTTP requests

âœ… FastAPI Microservice
 Created python-llm-service/app.py and rag_utils.py

 Installed FastAPI, Uvicorn, and created a Python virtual environment (venv)

 Built POST /generate route to receive input and return mock RAG response

 Created context/affordable-housing.md with seed data

 Fixed relative path issues using os.path.abspath()

âœ… Full Backend Flow Test
 Successfully tested /generate directly with curl

 Successfully tested full flow:

bash
Copy
Edit
User â†’ NestJS `/chatbot` â†’ FastAPI `/generate` â†’ Returns RAG response
ðŸŸ¦ Day 2 â€“ Frontend + Chat UI Setup
âœ… Next.js App Setup
 Scaffolded Next.js app with TypeScript using create-next-app inside sites/chatbot/

 Chose CSS Modules (no Tailwind)

 Disabled Turbopack (used Webpack for stability)

âœ… Chat UI Build

 Handled loading and error states in the UI

âœ… Frontend â†’ Backend Integration
 Connected frontend form to NestJS /chatbot route

 Displayed chatbot reply in real-time using local dev server

âœ… Final Functional Test
 Launched frontend on localhost:3000

 Typed a question

 Saw chatbot respond with context from Markdown file via full stack pipeline

ðŸŽ‰ Result: MVP Prototype Complete!
You now have a fully working Capstone MVP with:

âœ… Functional RAG chatbot logic

âœ… Modular architecture

âœ… Clean backend + microservice separation

âœ… Frontend UI and UX with real-time feedback

âœ… Clean repo and scalable codebase for future improvements
