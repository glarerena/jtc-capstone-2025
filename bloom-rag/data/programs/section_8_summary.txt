The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program helps low-income families, the elderly, and people with disabilities afford decent, safe, and sanitary housing in the private market. Participants pay a portion of rent based on income, while the voucher covers the rest.

Eligibility is based on income, family size, and citizenship status.
