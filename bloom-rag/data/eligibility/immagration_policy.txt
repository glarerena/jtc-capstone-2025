Eligibility for housing assistance varies. In general, most federally funded housing programs require applicants to be U.S. citizens or have eligible immigration status (such as lawful permanent residents). Undocumented immigrants are typically not eligible for federal programs like Section 8, but they may qualify for emergency or locally-funded aid in some jurisdictions.

Some nonprofits and local programs may provide shelter or assistance regardless of immigration status. Applicants should consult local housing authorities or community organizations for specific guidance.
