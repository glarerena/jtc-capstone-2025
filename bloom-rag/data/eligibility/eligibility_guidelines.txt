To qualify for affordable housing, applicants must meet income limits based on Area Median Income (AMI). Generally, eligibility requires income below 80% AMI, with priority for those under 50% AMI.

Eligibility is also affected by household size, citizenship status, and whether the applicant has prior evictions or criminal history. Some programs prioritize seniors, veterans, or people with disabilities.

Applicants should provide proof of income, identification, and household composition.
